# AI-Based 30-Day Hospital Readmission Prediction

This project develops machine-learning models to predict 30-day hospital readmission using electronic health record (EHR) data.

## Objective
To assess whether routinely collected clinical variables can be used to predict short-term hospital readmission and support early clinical decision-making.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC
- Model interpretation using SHAP

## Key Variables
- Age, gender
- Blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI
- Diabetes, hypertension
- Medication count
- Length of stay
- Discharge destination

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP, Google Colab

## Output
- Trained prediction models
- ROC curves and performance metrics
- Feature importance and explainability plots
